## Description
We - Go is a tourism application that allows the user to search the weather, points of interest, and tourism in select countries and the cities within the selected country.

## Introduction 
This week we were challenged to create our first project! Our group decided to create a tourism application! 

---

## Challenges

Our groups biggest challenge was really group participation. We started off with 5 team members and ended with two. Regardless we were still able to create an awesome application!

---

Another challenge we ran into was finding API's that were acceptable for this project. We eventually found two that worked perfectly!
